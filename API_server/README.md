First of all, you need mongoDB to be installed and running
To do so : 
- find where you installed it
- launch mongod.exe
- your Database is working :D


To start the server: 
- open node command prompt
- go to project folder
- type : node bin/www
- DONE ! you server is on localhost:3000

This is an API server, so no webpages, only json text
to find where you can go, check API/index.js to find the routes
